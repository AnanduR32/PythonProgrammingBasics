# Python Basics
This repository contains most of the basic programs taught early on in academia for python language.

## Data Structures 
* ### Built-in 
    * **Lists**: 
        * Can contain heterogenous data
        * Initialized using square brackets
        * Is mutable, new data can be appended, values can be removed and so on
    * **Tuple**:
        * Heterogenous data
        * Initialized using parenthesis
        * Is immutable
        * Faster than lists
    * **Dictionary**
        * Store data using key:value pairs
        * They are mutable
        * Initialized using curly brackets where the key:value pair is specified
        * Data is added to dictionary simply by specifying a new key and assigning a value to it, dict[key] = value
    * **Sets**
        * Unordered collection of unique elements
        * Sets are mutable 
        * can perform various actions that are possible in algebraic sets such as union, difference, intersection and so on
* ### User Defined
    * **Stack**
    * **Queue**
    * **Tree**
    * **Linked Lists**
    * **Graph**
    * **Hash Maps**
